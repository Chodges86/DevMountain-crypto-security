"RockStar Games cyber-security breach" 

        RockStar Games, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto game series was hacked on September 18th of 2022.  It appears that a hacker
    operating under the name teapotuberhacker was able to gain access to some video clips of GTA VI game play.  The game is still currently in development.  
    He then posted those videos on a social media platform and posted on GTAForums.com that he hacked RockStar Games and was able to steal 90 videos of 
    alpha footage and the source code for GTA VI and GTA V.  

        The hacker was able to gain access to a their internal network after an employee clicked on a malicious email.  He then gained access to the staff 
    member's Slack channel and downloaded the videos.  It is unclear how or if he actually was able to download the source code as he claims, but it has been
    reported that he was blackmailing RockStar Games to return the stolen source code. 

        In this case, the security failure happened with an employee who was unaware that he was allowing access to a threat.  Some other considerations that may should have been taken 
    into account with security, is the Slack channel containing sensitive information.  

        On September 22nd, a 17 year old was arrested in London on suspicion of hacking as part of the investigation into who is responsible for the RockStar Games security breach.  The
    17 year old is said to be a member of the hacking group "Lapsus$".  In his posts on GTAForums.com he claimed also to be a responsible for the Uber security-breach which occurred just
    3 days before on September 15th.  Lapsus$ has been responsible for many cyber-security attacks on well known organizations including Microsoft, T-mobile, Ubisoft, Samsung, and Nvidia.
